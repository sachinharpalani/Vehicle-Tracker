### Tech

Vehicle Tracker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django] - Framework for building webapps in Python.
* [W3.CSS] - UI template in HTML,CSS and JS

### Installation

Vehicle Tracker requires Python3 to run. If you have a Linux machine, dont worry your good to go. If not, please refer https://www.python.org/downloads/

Create a virtual env
```sh
$ cd Vehicle-Tracker/
~/Vehicle-Tracker (master) $ python3 -m venv env
~/Vehicle-Tracker (master) $ ls
env  requirements.txt  src
```
You will notice an env folder has been created.

Now we need to activate our virtual environment using following:
```sh
~/Vehicle-Tracker (master) $ source env/bin/activate
```

Note: In case you need to deactivate the virtual environment or no longer need it just run `deactivate` like this:
```
(env) ~/Vehicle-Tracker (master) $ deactivate
```

We notice `(env)` in the path name of our terminal. Now we have successfully activated our virtual environment. Lets install the required packages via `requirements.txt` file
```sh
(env) ~/Vehicle-Tracker (master) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Check if the packages installed in pip list are same as yours. We need these files for running the project.

Now we need to migrate our Database and runserver. Follow these steps:
```sh
(env) ~/Vehicle-Tracker (master) $ cd src/
(env) ~/Vehicle-Tracker/src (master) $ python3 manage.py migrate

```

If you see `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/` this means our server is now hosted on localhost at port 8000. Now we can go to `localhost:8000` and browse the webapp.

### Running Tests

Unit tests are written in `tests.py` and can be run by `python3 manage.py test`
```sh
(env) ~/projects/Vehicle-Tracker/src (master) $ python3 manage.py test
